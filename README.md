# Random Password Generator 
This webpage generates a random password according to selections that are made by the user. This can help create complex and secure passwords for people to use.
The webpage includes a button for the user to click to start the password generator. This will send promts to the user asking if they would like upper case, lower case, numbers or special characters included in their new password. After these prompts are answered, the page will then generate the new secure password.
